# Examples:
#
# > python myspace/profile.py 270977337
# Shows the profile of neurain
#
# > python myspace/friends.py -m 1 -q 1 270977337
# Lists the friends of neurain
#
# > python myspace/top_friends.py -m 1 -q 1 270977337
# Lists the ranked top friends of neurain
#
# > python myspace/recommend.py -m 1 -q 1 270977337
# Returns recommendations among friends of neurain
#
# > python myspace/directory.py
# Automatically runs 3-ties recommendations for every MySpace musician

# 09.04.13 Completed directory to automatically recommend artist:
#          - removed CAPTCHA thanks to the new "No more CAPTCHA" feature
#          - added min_common number of friends to recommend an artist

# 09.04.09 Added a directory function to complete the loop:
#          - gets the directory of musicians from MySpace
#          - runs the recommender on each of them
#          Corrected code for new version of MySpace friends page
#          Separated artist IDs from NAMEs in the cache files

# 09.01.31 Added more functions to recommend related artists:
#          - top_friends.py extracts the top friends of a MySpace profile
#          - recommend.py connects top friends that do not know each other

# 09.01.29 Separated different functions into independent modules:
#          - friends.py scrape MySpace for the friends of a profile
#          - compose.py send a message to a MySpace profile
#          To do: Ctrl Break to stop threaded functions
#          To do: Add profile.py, bestfriends.py, recommend.py
#          To do: Add a cron to schedule recommendations

# 09.01.26 Added threading model to speed up MySpace scraping.
#          Now scraping an artist like Bloc Party takes about 5 hours.
#          First recommendation system introduced.
#          No support for profile names yet 

# 09.01.22 First experiment with scraping MySpace to look for the closest
#          friend of a specific profile. Current limitations:
#          - No support for profile names, both because of Unicode and because
#            requires reading viewProfile page, more than viewFriends
#          - No complete check about friends being MySpace artists or not
#          - Limited friends of friends to those with <=1,000 friends
#          - cache/ directory should exist in the folder
#          - No multithread, slow process since one URL is loaded at the time
