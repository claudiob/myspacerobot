# 2009 - Claudio Baccigalupo

# 09.01.26 Added threading model to speed up MySpace scraping.
#          Now scraping an artist like Bloc Party takes about 5 hours.
#          First recommendation system introduced.
#          No support for profile names yet 

# 09.01.22 First experiment with scraping MySpace to look for the closest
#          friend of a specific profile. Current limitations:
#          - No support for profile names, both because of Unicode and because
#            requires reading viewProfile page, more than viewFriends
#          - No complete check about friends being MySpace artists or not
#          - Limited friends of friends to those with <=1,000 friends
#          - cache/ directory should exist in the folder
#          - No multithread, slow process since one URL is loaded at the time
